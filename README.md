# spring-boot-security-ep01

## Motivation

The motivation behind these episodes is to explore spring security in spring boot.

## Project Description

This project is an example of **In-Memory Authentication** and **Authorization** using spring security.
In this version of spring security, **WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter** is deprecated.
Authorization is done by **Form Login**.

I have made 2 users:

```
# : Username : Password : Role

1 : user     : user     : USER
2 : admin    : admin    : ADMIN
```

I have made 3 routes:

```
# : Route  : Description 

1 : /      : This is a home route and accessible by everyone.
2 : /admin : This is an admin route and accessible by ROLE_ADMIN.
3 : /user  : This is a user route and accessible by ROLE_USER. 
```
